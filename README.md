# Because of @GitHub, I've lost `E V E R Y T H I N G` on the private repository that I wasn't going to push, because it's private, but when I switched to **_main_**, that was it... everything lost.

## There's A LOT to be said but ironically, the **FACT** that there was no version control to manage the various achitectural failures on your end is a business model and mission statement failure. (@GitHub)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is a starter for building a GRANDstack (GraphQL, React, Apollo, Neo4j Database) application. There are two components to the project:

1.  Web App (**_React JS(X)_** _Client_)
2.  API App (**_GraphQL_** _Server_).

Eventually this project will incorporate a Mobile & DBMS app.

- Mobile App (**_React-Native_** _Client_)
- DBMS App (**_CypherQL_** _DBOps_)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

**HUGE S/O** to the devs over at [GRANDStack](https://github.com/grand-stack), you guys are awesome!
